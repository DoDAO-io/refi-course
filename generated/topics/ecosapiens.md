## Ecosapiens
 
Ecosapiens is a Web3 NFT project that wraps carbon credits in NFTs in an effort to commoditize carbon credits and promote their  general consumer use. As of now, Ecosapiens runs on the Ethereum blockchain which is famous for its NFT marketplaces. Ecosapiens makes  it easy for consumers to buy carbon credits by offering carbon credits in the form of NFTs containing carbon credits which can be bought,  resold, and even “evolved” into a rarer NFT. The NFTs are a humanoid combination of the flora and fauna of mother earth.
