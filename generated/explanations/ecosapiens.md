 ## Ecosapiens
 
 **Introduction to Ecosapiens**        
### Introduction to ecosapiens

Ecosapiens is a Web3 NFT project that wraps carbon credits in NFTs in an effort to commoditize carbon credits and promote their  general consumer use. As of now, Ecosapiens runs on the Ethereum blockchain which is famous for its NFT marketplaces. Ecosapiens makes  it easy for consumers to buy carbon credits by offering carbon credits in the form of NFTs containing carbon credits which can be bought, resold, and even “evolved” into a rarer NFT. The NFTs are a humanoid combination of the flora and fauna of mother earth.

### Working 

Before shifting the carbon credits on-chain, we need to look at what carbon credits are shifted on-chain by EcoSapiens. When it comes to offsetting, there are three kinds of carbon offsetting projects:

1. **Carbon removal:** credits issued for capturing carbon emissions

2. **Carbon reduction:** credits issued for shrinking emissions

3. **Carbon protection:** credits issued to avoid the creation of emissions   

Of these, EcoSapiens only accepts projects that are dealing with carbon removal. These could be projects working on reforestation, blue algae production etc. It is important to note that the selection  process is centralized and decided upon by the team at EcoSapiens. To improve their selection process, they also incorporate carbon rating agencies like Sylvera into their selection process to legitimize  the carbon credits that back their NFTs. We will look deeper into the working of Ecosapiens in the coming sections. 
 **Carbon-to-NFT**        
### Carbon-to-NFT

EcoSapiens uses something called a carbon-to-NFT bridge to bridge the real world carbon credits onto the blockchain. This could be understood better by saying that the real world carbon credits are used to back the minted NFTs, this way each NFT has the same value as the amount of carbon credit that is being wrapped by it.

On top of that, each time the NFT is traded, new carbon credits are added to the number of carbon credits already backing the NFT, offsetting each transaction on the blockchain. This feature is called “payback-to-offset” and is triggered automatically each time the NFT is traded. The newly added carbon credits are paid for by a fixed percentage of royalty that comes with each NFT.

Ecosapiens also uses another mechanism called impact-2-earn to incentivize the users for their continued participation in buying carbon credits. 
 **Impact-2-earn**        
### Impact-2-earn

As you can imagine, buying new ecosapiens each time to offset your emissions for the year would become mundane. In order to make long term participation more fun, Ecosapiens use impact-2-earn. Ecosapiens will introduce events that allow the user to “evolve” their Ecosapien by acquiring more carbon credits under their NFT. During this event period, users can buy carbon packs, enabling the user to sequester more carbon. As more and more carbon is sequestered under the Ecosapien, it will evolve more. 

Each of the “evolutions” or “upgrades” are called carbon infusions. The user obtains their Ecosapien at level 1, with an offset of 16 tons of carbon. The user will be able to do a carbon infusion by buying 2 tons of carbon, at this point, the Ecosapien will reach level 2. To advance to the next level, the user has to sequester 2 tons of carbon under the Ecosapien. The Ecosapien can undergo carbon infusions until a maximum of level 7. At this point, the Ecosapien is fully advanced and has sequestered 28 tons ``( 16 + 2 * 6 = 28 )`` of carbon, equivalent to roughly two years of carbon emissions by the average american. The more evolved the Ecosapien, the more rare it is. This way, the user is incentivized for sequestering carbon credits over a long period of time. Since, the rarer the NFT, the higher its price, it makes it worthwhile for the user to indulge in impact-2-earn while also positively impacting the environment.

Having a fully evolved / leveled up Ecosapien is not only equivalent to holding a rare NFT, but it also contributes to the environment in a positive way by offsetting 2 years worth of emissions by an average american. On top of that, a fully leveled up Ecosapien will act as a form of virtue signaling that could drive a cultural movement, encouraging more people to be climate positive.

### Ecosapiens NFT

Each Ecosapien (Ecosapiens NFT) is backed by carbon credits worth 16 metric tonnes of CO2, which is a year's worth of the average American’s carbon output. Each Ecosapien has metadata about the project its carbon credits are derived from. Each Ecosapien’s design is based on some concept of flora, fauna, minerals and ores found in our home planet. Also, each of these Ecosapien NFTs also contain data on a climate crisis, and its solution. The metadata of each NFT will point to the carbon certificate, letting the user know about the rating for the carbon credit, the project it comes from etc.

The initial 16 tons of carbon offsetted by buying the NFT is not all, users can sequester more carbon into their Ecosapien using the Impact-2-earn model, via which more carbon can be sequestered into each Ecosapien while simultaneously, “evolving” and changing the appearance of the NFT.

**Drop**

350 pieces of “Chrysalis” (mentioned earlier as “level 0”) will be released on Feb 22, 2023. These chrysalis can be swapped for an Ecosapien a week later. At this stage, the user will receive an Ecosapien at level 1 with 16 tons of carbon offsetted. From then, each week after that the user can upgrade their Ecosapien to the next level by carbon fusion. For this drop, there is only one type of Ecosapien that can be acquired, it has various generative rarity properties by leveling it up, giving way for uniqueness among the different NFTs.
