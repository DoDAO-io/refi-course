    "Ecosapien NFT is dynamic" why or why not?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: |
   The Ecosapien NFT comes with 16tons of carbon credits that is enough to offset the entire year of emissions of the average american. On top of this, the user can accumulate more carbon into their NFT using impact-2-earn module
   and offset upto two years of emissions. Accumulating carbon credits in the NFT will "evolve" it into higher, rare forms. Thus, it is dynamic.
