    title: Introduction
    details: >+
      Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
      code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or
      security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code,
      evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the
      contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal
      of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and
      reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a
      blockchain network.

       Ecosapiens is a Web3 NFT project that wraps carbon credits in NFTs in an effort to commoditize carbon credits and promote their 
       general consumer use. As of now, Ecosapiens runs on the Ethereum blockchain which is famous for its NFT marketplaces. Ecosapiens makes 
       it easy for consumers to buy carbon credits by offering carbon credits in the form of NFTs containing carbon credits which can be bought, 
       resold, and even “evolved” into a rarer NFT. The NFTs are a humanoid combination of the flora and fauna of mother earth.
